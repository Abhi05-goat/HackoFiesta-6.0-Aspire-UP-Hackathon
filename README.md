# Project Title
**AI-Driven Solution for Natural Disaster Management**

## Overview
This project aims to provide a proactive and efficient solution for natural disaster management by leveraging AI to predict and manage events like floods and droughts. By analyzing weather patterns, satellite imagery, and historical data, the system offers insights to aid decision-makers in resource allocation, risk mitigation, and response planning.

## Features
- **Weather Pattern Analysis**: Analyzes real-time weather data for anomaly detection.
- **Historical Data Insights**: Processes historical data to identify patterns and correlations.
- **Satellite Imagery Integration**: Supports integration with satellite data for geographical analysis.
- **Predictive Models**: Uses machine learning algorithms to predict disaster likelihood and severity.
- **Customizable Dashboards**: Provides user-friendly dashboards for visualizing insights.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Generates timely alerts to stakeholders.

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection**:
    - Gather real-time weather data.
    - Utilize historical datasets and satellite imagery.
2. **Preprocessing**:
    - Clean and preprocess data.
    - Normalize satellite imagery for consistent analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**:
    - Extract key features from weather and historical data.
    - Incorporate temporal and spatial attributes.
4. **Model Training**:
    - Train predictive models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
    - Validate using historical events.
5. **Prediction & Visualization**:
    - Deploy models for real-time predictions.
    - Visualize insights on dashboards.
6. **Alert Generation**:
    - Notify stakeholders via SMS, email, or app notifications.
